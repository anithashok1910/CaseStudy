                    <h2>Company at a Glance</h2>
                    <p>We started out in 1982 in Gurgaon, Haryana. Little did the then quiet suburb of New Delhi know, that it was going to become the epicenter of the automobile revolution in India. The year marked the birth of the Maruti Suzuki factory. India turned out 40,000 cars every year. The new Maruti Suzuki 800 hit the streets to begin a whole new chapter in the Indian automobile industry.</p>
                    <p>We set out with an obsession for customer delight, one that was unheard in the corridors of automobile manufacturers then. It was about a commitment to create value through innovation, quality, creativity, partnerships, openness and learning. It created a road that was going to lead the world in to a whole new direction, laid out by Maruti Suzuki.</p>

                        <h2>Better thinking. Better processes. Better technologies. More sensitivity. It's what helps us create better cars and of course, a better way of life.</h2>
                        <p>Big ideas that make a difference to your life. They're what power the Maruti Suzuki philosophy of cars for a ‘Big Future’. It's the cornerstone of all that we do, be it a more aerodynamic shell for a concept car, or a better way to recycle wastewater at our plants. It's what drives the R&D efforts of our team of over 1000 engineers and service quality across all Maruti Suzuki dealers and service centers in India.</p>
                        <p>We're looking at the road ahead. With a view to enhance our capabilities, we are setting up a state-of-the-art R&D centre in Rohtak, Haryana at an investment of Rs. 2000 crore. Spread over an area of 600 acres, this R&D center will be equipped to churn out not just high mileage petrol cars, but test tracks and labs among many other advanced facilities that will be operational by 2015.</p>

                        <h2>Buy it, run it or sell it, a Maruti Suzuki car gives you an unmatched value.</h2>
                        <p>The price of high mileage petrol cars in India is just a third of what you will pay for over its lifetime. The balance two-thirds include, maintenance, cost of spares and service, and resale. Together, they make up what is called the cost of ownership. It's where nothing can beat a Maruti Suzuki car.</p>
                        <p>India, we know, is driven by a deep value consciousness. Every year on an average, our manufacturing units churn out around 1.2 million petrol cars and diesel cars. Economies of scale help us in keeping our manufacturing cost low. The continued VA-VE initiatives (Value Analysis & Value Engineering) pursued aggressively in partnership with vendors also help reduce the cost of making Maruti Suzuki cars without compromising on quality.</p>

                        <h2>Yes, you can get lost in India, but chances are, that there will be a Maruti Suzuki Dealer or a Maruti Suzuki Service Station close at hand. Wherever you go, across the length and breadth of this vast nation, our service network follows.</h2>
                        <p>It's the widest service network. It's the deepest service network. And, when you service 40,000 diesel and petrol cars a day with an unmatched 'first-time right' score, we can say that you won't find a better, more committed service network anywhere in the world.</p>
                        <p>We've even got an award for it. Maruti Suzuki Service has been No.1 in the J D Power Customer Satisfaction Award for 16 years in a row. It's a survey that rates the after-sales service experience, one that no other global car market leader has won even once.</p>
